# Basic-Cog-Bot

Basically, I wanted to make a bot that doesn't require much thought for new people. It's got some logging and 'database' functionality for json. This is the basic setup for the bot I run on my server. It's made for a single server so put it on multiple servers at your own risk. I'll update it when I want to add something or I'm made aware of an issue. All of the cogs on my github will be made to run in this bot base.

# Getting Started
- Clone the repo and install the requirements with `pip`.
- Create a bot app and get the login token [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
- You can either run `bot.py` directly or using the `.bat` or `.sh` files. The `.sh` file will need to be executable.
- Put in your discord token when asked and confirm your settings. These will only be asked first time it's booted, settings can be changed with commands.
- That should be it, you've successfully started the Basic Cog Bot. üëç

# What now?
- I don't know, maybe add some cogs or look into building your own? ü§∑‚Äç

# Notes
- Python 3.6 is required.
- This bot is built on [discord.py rewite](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite). Be aware of this when you're looking for tutorials on how to make a cog or use discord.py.
- [Documentation](http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/index.html) for using discord.py rewrite.
